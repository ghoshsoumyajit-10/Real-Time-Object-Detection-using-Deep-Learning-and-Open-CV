# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Open-CV
This project presents a real-time multi-object detection pipeline using a pre-trained Single Shot Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone. Leveraging OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework, the system performs efficient inference on images and video streams while detecting 80 object categories from the COCO dataset.
