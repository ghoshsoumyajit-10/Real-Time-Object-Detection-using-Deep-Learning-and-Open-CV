# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Open-CV
This project presents a real-time multi-object detection pipeline using a pre-trained Single Shot Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone. Leveraging OpenCV’s Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework, the system performs efficient inference on images and video streams while detecting 80 object categories from the COCO dataset.

This project implements a real-time object detection system using a pre-trained deep learning model integrated with OpenCV’s DNN (Deep Neural Network) module.
The system is capable of detecting and classifying multiple objects simultaneously from images, video files, or live camera streams.

The project demonstrates practical application of computer vision, convolutional neural networks, and deep learning inference pipelines in a real-world scenario.
